Mplus-for-st2
==============

Mplus syntax highlighting for sublime text 2.

Will include syntax highlighting for inputs and outputs, code snippets, autocompletion, a dedicated theme, and ability to run in Mplus.

Move the settings files (including build file) into your User folder within the sublime packages folder.

Mac OSX:
Take the shell script (Mplus.sh) and place this into your Mplus folder (/Applications/Mplus/). In order for this to work, sublime text 2 must be in your /Applications folder and the Mplus program must be in /Applications/Mplus/ as well.


Currently in development, stay tuned!
